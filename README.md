# fizzbuzz-scala

A FizzBuzz application that takes a number and plays FizzBuzz up to that point. Results are displayed in the console.

## Approach

I built this application to learn the basics of Scala and how to TDD an application in the language. I used the ScalaTest framework for testing and followed the red, green, refactor cycle to test each element of the project as I progressed.
